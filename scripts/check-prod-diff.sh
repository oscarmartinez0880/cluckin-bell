# Production Change Validation Script
# 
# TODO: Implement production-only path validation in future phase
# This script will enforce that production deployments only come from 
# the 'main' branch and prevent direct pushes to prod paths.
#
# Planned features:
# - Validate current branch is 'main' for prod-related changes
# - Check that prod values/charts changes have proper approval workflow
# - Enforce production readiness checklist compliance
# - Integration with branch protection policies
#
# For now, this is a placeholder that always exits successfully
# to allow the GitOps restructure Phase 1 to proceed without
# blocking existing workflows.
